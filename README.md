# React Pretty Forms

A light-weight, easy-to-use component library that takes care of the tedious parts of form-building for you:

* form prefills with query parameters
* extensible default validators
* exposes form values in JSON format
* hooks for easy management of submitting, failure, and success states
* default styles
* semantic HTML

## Motivation

abstract away common tasks like
a) form prefills from query parameters
b) collecting input values for JS manipulation
c) component display dependent on form status
d) validation
e) default styling
